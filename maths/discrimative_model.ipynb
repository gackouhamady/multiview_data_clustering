    "# Discriminative Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "Discriminative models focus on modeling the conditional probability:\n",
    "$$ P(y|x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike generative models that model joint probability:\n",
    "$$ P(x,y) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Classifier\n",
    "Decision function:\n",
    "$$ f(x;w) = \\arg\\max_y w^T \\phi(x,y) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $w$ = weight vector\n",
    "- $\\phi(x,y)$ = joint feature vector\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "Conditional probability formulation:\n",
    "$$ P(y|x;w) = \\frac{1}{Z(x;w)} \\exp(w^T \\phi(x,y)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With partition function:\n",
    "$$ Z(x;w) = \\sum_y \\exp(w^T \\phi(x,y)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization via log-likelihood:\n",
    "$$ L(w) = \\sum_i \\log p(y^i|x^i;w) $$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Discriminative Models\n",
    "1. Higher accuracy for classification tasks\n",
    "2. More efficient computation\n",
    "3. Direct modeling of $P(y\\|x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "1. Requires labeled data\n",
    "2. Can't generate new samples\n",
    "3. May need feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization Techniques\n",

    "5. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hybrid Approaches\n",
    "Recent work combines both paradigms:\n",
    "- Generative-discriminative tradeoffs\n",
    "- Multi-conditional learning\n",
    "- Feature extraction with LDA/PCA\n",
